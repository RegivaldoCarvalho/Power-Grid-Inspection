# Power-Grid-Inspection
A novel approach to automate the inspection of power lines.

## Requirements

Install the programs above:

### Python 3.6.6 - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/

### TensorFlow - https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ 

To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
```
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow you need a GPU card with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher.
If you have it, install the CUDAÂ® Toolkit 9.0 and cuDNN v7.0 for CUDA 9.0 
- https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/

- https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

- https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html#ixzz56wCXCTwH

Copy cuDNN files to directories below:

-`cudnn64_7.dll (cuda\bin\cudnn64_5.dll) into C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin\;`

-`cuda\include\cudnn.h to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\include\;`

-`and cuda\lib\x64\cudnn.lib to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\lib\x64\`

WHERE C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0 is the install PATH for the CUDA toolkit.

Then add this diretory to environment variable on windows:
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin\

```bash
control sysdm.cpl
```

After that use the following command to intall TensorFlow for GPU

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```

### Keras - https://keras.io/#installation

Enter the following command:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade keras
```


### Visual Studio 2017 - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15#

Install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 

Following these instructions

https://www.scivision.co/python-windows-visual-c++-14-required/

Remeber to install "Windows Universal CRT SDK"

1 - Run Visual Studio Installer.
2 - Select Modify button.
3 - Go to "Individual Components" tab.
4 - Scroll down to "Compilers, build tools and runtimes".
5 - Tick "Windows Universal CRT SDK".
6 - Install.


### COCOAPI - https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi

First Clone the repository to your diretory

Then: 

```
To compile and install locally run "python setup.py build_ext --inplace"
To install library to Python site-packages run "python setup.py build_ext install"
```

When you run make under the PythonAPI folder, actually you run the command python setup.py build_ext --inplace, within which your default python(mostly python2) is called. So, just run the command python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace in the PythonAPI folder for python3.

To solve problemas with Visual Studio on Windows

I didnt try it but it seems works for some people: 

```bash
COCOAPI repository for windows - https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi
```
